# Go2 Semantic Navigation

> **Open-vocabulary object navigation for the Unitree Go2 quadruped, on Isaac Sim warehouse.**
> A natural-language command (e.g. `"find chair"`) triggers autonomous frontier exploration, open-vocabulary YOLOE detection, semantic memory accumulation, and goal-directed navigation — all in one FSM.

## What this is

A simulation-first semantic navigation stack for the Unitree Go2, built on Isaac Sim 5.1, ROS 2 Jazzy, SLAM Toolbox, Nav2, and **YOLOE open-vocabulary detection**. The robot:

1. Receives a natural-language command on `/user_command` (e.g. `"find chair"`, `"find table"`).
2. Autonomously explores the unknown warehouse via frontier-based exploration.
3. Detects target objects with YOLOE — open-vocabulary, so adding a new class requires only extending a string list, no retraining.
4. Builds a persistent semantic memory of detected landmarks (visible vs. remembered).
5. Plans an approach goal around the target and navigates there via Nav2 with social-aware costmap inflation.

## Pre-flight setup (run once)

```bash
# 0. Clone and enter the project root
git clone https://github.com/YiyuchenHu/GO2-semantic-navigation.git
cd GO2-semantic-navigation

# 1. ROS 2 dependencies
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
  ros-jazzy-navigation2 ros-jazzy-nav2-bringup \
  ros-jazzy-slam-toolbox ros-jazzy-rviz2 \
  ros-jazzy-pointcloud-to-laserscan ros-jazzy-topic-tools \
  ros-jazzy-tf2-geometry-msgs ros-jazzy-vision-msgs \
  ros-jazzy-cv-bridge

# 2. Python dependencies (YOLOE via ultralytics)
pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# 3. Pre-fetch YOLOE weights (~600 MB, one-time)
python3 -c "from ultralytics import YOLOE; YOLOE('yoloe-11s-seg.pt')"

# 4. Build the colcon workspace
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install

# 5. Configure local paths
# Edit scripts/dev_env.sh and set ISAAC_SIM_ROOT to your Isaac Sim install path.
```

> **Note on the NVIDIA People Pack:** the social-cost halo around the
> `person` class requires Isaac Sim's optional People Pack assets. The
> default `find chair` / `find table` demo does **not** depend on this —
> it is only used when extending the demo to person-aware avoidance.

---

## Quick Start — Command-first demo

Open **three terminals**. In each one, first source the local env:

```bash
source scripts/dev_env.sh
```

Then:

```bash
# T1 — Isaac Sim warehouse (keep running)
bash scripts/run_warehouse_ros2.sh

# T2 — Full semantic navigation stack
# (wait until Isaac Sim is fully up and publishing /camera/* and /lidar/points)
ros2 launch go2_bringup_sim command_first_demo.launch.py

# T3 — RViz
bash scripts/run_rviz.sh
```

Wait ~20 seconds for SLAM Toolbox to publish the first `/map`. Then publish a natural-language command:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /user_command std_msgs/msg/String "data: 'find chair'"
# or:
ros2 topic pub --once /user_command std_msgs/msg/String "data: 'find table'"
```

Monitor the FSM:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /task_coordinator/state
```

**Expected progression:**

```
IDLE → PARSE_COMMAND → CHECK_MEMORY → TARGET_NOT_FOUND
     → EXPLORE → ... → TARGET_FOUND → PLAN_APPROACH_GOAL
     → NAVIGATE_TO_GOAL → ARRIVED
```

## Natural-language commands

The `nl_parser` recognises any phrase that resolves to a class in YOLOE's allowlist. Out of the box:

| Input phrase(s)                          | Resolved class  |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `find chair`, `go to chair`              | `chair`         |
| `find table`, `find desk`, `find workbench` | `table`     |
| `find person`, `find people`             | `person`        |

**Adding a new target class** requires only extending the `classes` and `nl_known_classes` launch arguments in `command_first_demo.launch.py` — no retraining, no code changes elsewhere.

## Known limitations

- **Simulation only.** This demo runs exclusively in Isaac Sim; it has not been deployed on a physical Unitree Go2.
- **Navigation arrival reporting.** Under certain costmap inflation conditions, the FSM may report `FAILED` after the robot has physically reached the target vicinity (Nav2 `xy_goal_tolerance` vs. inflated obstacle layer near large furniture). Workaround: increase `xy_goal_tolerance` in `nav2_params_social.yaml` for the controller.
- **Semantic marker deduplication is per-session.** Re-detections of the same object across long horizons may register as new markers; cross-session persistence is future work.
- **View-dependent detection.** YOLOE confidence on table/chair depends on viewing angle; sparse depth returns near object edges can produce occasional ghost anchors.

---

## Future Work

Three directions naturally extend this work:

1. **Long-term semantic memory** — cross-session marker persistence and deduplication, enabling long-horizon inspection in large-scale environments.
2. **Richer command grounding** — replacing the keyword-based `/user_command` with a vision-language-action (VLA) front-end for compositional instructions.
3. **Dynamic obstacle handling and social-aware planning** — extending beyond marking-layer inflation to model human motion and personal-space constraints when sharing the warehouse with workers.

The Unitree Go2 platform is particularly well-suited to these directions: a legged base allows close interaction with humans on unstructured floors, beyond what wheeled platforms (e.g., TurtleBot) can offer.
